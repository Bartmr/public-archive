## Github as Portfolio and Life

---

## Who am I

- I was in Academia de Código, 5th bootcamp, end of 2016
- Full stack: Web, Backend, Mobile apps and now AI apps
- I develop products from scratch for startups
- Work as a freelancer

---

## What is Git
---

Git is a pile of envelopes, stacked by time, containing all the changes that happened since the beginning of the project
![[envelopes.png|400]]

---

When you do `git add .` you are writing down what you changed

---

When you do `git commit` you are putting those changes in an envelope and stamping them with an unique signature
![[stamping-envelopes.png|400]]

---

When you create a **new branch**, you are starting a new stack of envelopes, on top of the original stack

---

When you call `git push`, you are sending those envelopes to your company’s giant stack of envelopes

---

A **git project** is nothing more than the sum of all the changes that happened since its beginning

---

Github is a social network of people reporting changes to their projects, till they become something.

Instead of pictures, they upload and comment changes.

---

### Why have a Github profile?

---

Github should not be where you try to capture audience

---

Your Github profile is the product, not the attention grabber

---

The people responsible for hiring are not on Github, and even if they were, they do not hunt for people there.

Github is terrible for searching people and skills.

---

It was designed for finding out projects, not people

---

**LinkedIn** should be your storefront,

the window that attracts customers to…

---

…go into your store (your **Github** profile) and check out the products you are selling (your code)

---

**Interviews are broken.**

Use your projects to divert interviewers from:

- useless exercises of things you will never do (like reversing a tree)  
- personality tests
- cognitive tests
- treating you like a number

---

**Hiring managers** and **tech** aren’t able to talk and know each other due to the stressful pace of the world and siloing of knowledge

---

**Hiring managers** will bring outdated methods to evaluate your value

---

**Tech** will try to put you in a “size competition”, putting you complicated exercises and questions that have nothing to do with the job

---

Stop them on their tracks. Show them something useful right from the start.

---

Show that you alone can develop interesting things that are useful for you.

The old **"I’m fine by myself"**

---

## How do I start building a convincing profile and projects?

---

Bring in the green stuff (not money, for now)

---
"He must be so dedicated, putting in so much hard work…"

---

Nope

---

It’s not a bot either.

See the differences in intensity and empty spots on weekends and vacations

---

Mostly, it’s my shopping list and todos

---

### Quick wins

-   create a private project with your notes for yourself
-   create a public project with notes that you want to share with everybody
-   Have a CV in `markdown`

---

Having a public repository for your notes is the perfect way to show what you know and what you aiming at knowing now

---

Fill it with scripts from your daily life (more on that later).
Build lists of tools and checklists for your processes.
Have a public second brain made out of text and automations

---

This is the one way to be transparent with potential employers

---

Example: <https://github.com/Bartmr/be-in-public>

---

### Markdown

---

A **parsable** format for writing prose. It can be read by **human** and **machines**.

---

A declarative way of structuring text, that can be converted into
- web pages
- documentation
- print
- and even this presentation

with any styles you want

---

By writing a CV in markdown, you can write all about you and customize the looks of it or pick any medium to share it (like a website)

---

![[Pasted image 20230503130157.png]]

---

Bash

---

Bash scripting is just chaining the terminal commands you know with some logic

---

They can be called manually or automatically

---

No need to setup any infrastructure or build system.

Automate your life right when you need it

---

Example: <https://github.com/Bartmr/be-in-public/tree/main/core/git>

---

### Jupyter

---

Markdown + code

---

### I want to build a project now

---
Ideas:

-   build something useful for you
-   remake other products

---

Build something useful for you

Inspire yourself on endless `awesome` lists available at Github

---

Remake a product

A lot of products are actually easy to replicate. The hardest part of their business was to reach their current solution, their network and operations.

---

Don’t spend much time contributing to other projects.

To the eyes of the stakeholders, they will never be yours, and they won’t even spend time checking them on your profile

---

Don’t commit build artifacts into your projects.

Avoid binary data when possible

Use `.gitignore`

---

- Most people who understand how to run your project want to run using their own setup. This means different configuration values, API keys and mainly, different operative systems.

- a build artifact is almost the same as hard-coding a whole product for your machine

---

Have your project ready to be consumed

---

From the interested side that should mean:
-   Installing dependencies
-   Setting environment variables
-   Starting all services in a single command (and I mean all services: database, backend, frontend, queuing, etc.)

---

Use _Docker_ and _Docker Compose_ to help someone interested run your project quickly

---

Docker is a way of describing a machine and having it run your project

This method of describing machines is called **infrastructure-as-code**

---

Always document how to run your project.
Use screenshots and pictures if possible.

---

Add licenses to your project

<https://choosealicense.com/>

---

Even better would be to setup a _CI_, and have your project available in a public URL or deployed as a dependency, ready to be used.

Look into **Github Actions**

---

Avoid binary data in your life, because…

---

Text is king

---

Text shares knowledge

Text can build into pictures

Text can build into sound

---

Text is business logic and automation

Text is readable by machines and humans

Text can virtualize machines and setup servers, as we saw with infrastructure-as-code

---

Text can be changed and tracked, back-and-forth.

Changes are **non-destructive**

---

## Guide your client through the your store

---

Always document things as if you had amnesia

Write down all the steps to get your project running in a README.md file

---

### Walk him through the aisle of your projects

---

I'm not scrolling through that

---

## Be social

It’s considered enlightened if it’s about code

---

Monthly users

Facebook: 2 950 million

Github: 100 million

---

Start each others projects

1 star = 29.5 likes on Facebook

---

Follow your colleagues and other developers

---

Use Github for mindless scrolling (better than the drama of conventional social media)
